Data ingested into InfluxDB must conform to the retention period set on the database.
Any data which lies outside of this retention period is no longer considered for retrieval by a query, but can have references maintained in object storage or the Postgres catalog, causing an increase in operational overhead and drive higher costs.

In order to reduce these factors, it is important to manage the lifecycle of ingested data. You can achieve this by following the best practices below:

- Use a retention policy which is appropriate for your requirements.
- Tune the garbage collector cutoff period to ensure that data is removed in a timely manner.
- Enable versioning in your object store and use lifecycle rules to expire old data.

### Garbage collector tuning

Once data falls outside of the retention period it can now be removed by the garbage collector service.

There are two variables which tune this process:

- `INFLUXDB_IOX_GC_OBJECTSTORE_CUTOFF`: the age at which a parquet file not referenced in the catalog becomes eligible for deletion from object storage. The default is `30d`.
- `INFLUXDB_IOX_GC_PARQUETFILE_CUTOFF`: defines how long to retain the row referencing a parquet file in the catalog once marked for deletion. The default is `30d`.

You may set them to a value that is appropriate for your use case, for example a value of `6h` (6 hours) would be appropriate for maintaining a lean catalog that only maintains references to recent data.

This can be set in your `AppInstance` configuration like so:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubecfg.dev/v1alpha1
kind: AppInstance
metadata:
  name: influxdb
  namespace: influxdb
spec:
  package:
    # Surrounding configuration parameters have been snipped for brevity
    spec:
      components:
       garbage-collector:
         template:
           containers:
             iox:
               env:
                 INFLUXDB_IOX_GC_OBJECTSTORE_CUTOFF: '6h',
                 INFLUXDB_IOX_GC_PARQUETFILE_CUTOFF: '6h',
```

Our recommendation is to keep these values aligned.

### Lifecycle rules

**We highly recommend that you use object versioning if you are expiring data using lifecycle rules.**

You can use lifecycle rules to ensure that old versions of data are not kept around any longer than necessary - this could cause a significant increase in storage costs over a long period.

We recommend that you use lifecycle rules to expire data after a set period of time, which matches your required backup duration for your organisation.

For example, an [AWS S3 lifecycle rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) to expire non-current objects after 90 days will look like the following:

```json
{
    "Rules": [
        {
            "ID": "my-lifecycle-rule",
            "Filter": {
                "Prefix": ""
            },
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "NoncurrentVersionExpiration": {
                "NoncurrentDays": 90
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
